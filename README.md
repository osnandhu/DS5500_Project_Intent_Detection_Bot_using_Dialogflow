### DS5500 Project 2 : Intent Detection Bot using Dialogflow
***Professor In-Charge: Andrew Therriault***
***Project Partners : Ankit Phaterpekar, Nanditha Sundararajan***

#### INTRODUCTION ####
Conversational bots have many applications throughout the industry today as businesses are looking to take advantage of deploying such services on messaging platforms, voice assistant devices like Google Home, Alexa or customer service bots with the goal of improving user interaction, reducing time or freeing up time taken to service simple tasks.
Our goal was to explore building a task oriented chatbot into an initial minimum viable product that can aid in providing information about business (restaurants, grocery stores, retail stores, pharmacies, etc) from the Yelp directory, such as finding business location, operating hours or notify the user about any nearby events as well as  automate some of the tasks that go into a reservation system or placing an order. We believe collecting feedback on this initial version and future development cycles would lead to a fully fleshed out agent that could be used by Yelp or Opentable for providing alternate ways to engage with the customer in lieu of the traditional website search.
